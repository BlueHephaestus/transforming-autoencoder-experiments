My miscellaneous (and initially unorganized) experiments to replicate, and then experiment with, Geoffrey Hinton's new capsule theory. This is through the usage of autoencoders trained so as to be equivariant to the position of input images, and then use generated features to train networks that can generalize far better than those without, with a lot of testing on the MNIST dataset initially.
